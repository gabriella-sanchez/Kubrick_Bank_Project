# Kubrick_Bank_Project
Project for Kubrick Group data engineering training looking at banking data to generate insights on customer behaviour.

Banking Project Overview

###Objective: 

Enhance the retail bank's services by identifying key customer segments and analyzing patterns in customer behavior. The goal is to distinguish between potentially valuable and profitable customers versus those who may pose a risk, ultimately guiding the bank toward more informed decision-making.

###Data Sources:

Accounts: Contains static characteristics of each bank account, detailing the branch information and account creation details (4500 records).
Clients: Describes individual customers who own the accounts (5369 records).
Disposition: Links customers to their respective accounts, indicating whether they are single or joint account holders (5369 records).
Permanent Orders: Details on recurring payment orders set up by account holders (6471 records).
Transactions: Records individual transactions per account, providing insights into spending patterns and account activity (over 1 million records).
Loans: Information on loans granted per account, useful for assessing credit risk (682 records).
Credit Cards: Data on credit cards issued, indicating customer credit utilization (892 records).
Demographic Data: Public demographic data of the districts where customers reside, useful for socioeconomic profiling (77 records).

###Approach:

Data Integration: Combine data from multiple sources to form a comprehensive view of each customerâ€™s financial behavior and background.
Data Analysis: Utilize statistical and machine learning techniques to segment customers based on risk and profitability. This involves identifying patterns in account transactions, loan repayments, and credit card usage.
Behavioral Insights: Leverage demographic data to enrich the analysis, correlating district-level economic indicators with customer behavior to predict financial stability and spending patterns.
Predictive Modeling: Develop models to forecast future customer behavior and identify potential upsell opportunities or risks.

###Deliverables:

Customer Segmentation Report: A detailed classification of customers, highlighting those who are likely to be profitable versus those who are high risk.
Behavioral Analysis Presentation: Visualizations and insights on spending patterns, loan repayments, and credit card usage, segmented by customer demographics.
Predictive Insights: Models and forecasts outlining potential future trends in customer behavior.
Strategic Recommendations: Actionable strategies for the bank to target valuable customers, manage risks, and tailor their services based on the analysis.
This project will provide the bank with critical insights into their customer base, enabling strategic decisions that could lead to enhanced profitability and reduced financial risk.
